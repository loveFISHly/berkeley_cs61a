"""
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

Pick a positive integer x as the start.
If x is even, divide it by 2.
If x is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Continue this process until x is 1.

Print the hailstone sequence starting at x and return its length.

        count += 1
